Cloud9 IDE Images

An all-too-necessary image collection.

Back Story
----------

Once upon a time, there was a little elf who lived in a little village in modern-day Uzbekistan.
This little elf was familiar with the ancient art of JavaScript programming. And when he stumbled across and odd little IDE while canoeing around the proxeas, he was excited.
Using a little of his elven magic, the little elf opened up the secrets of the IDE. It was unlike any other IDE he had ever seen: It was in the great cloud that held up the floating city of Blogos, and the dark 4Chan and others.
The little elf got to work right away. He began coding, and coding, and before he knew it he had a full scale proof-of-concept online.
The elf was thrilled! He showed his friends, but they all said, "It looks ugly."
So, the elf began putting images up. The IDE had a drag-and-drop interface from the desktop, so he tried that. But every time, the image came out corrupted.
The little elf cried all day, for what was he to do? But then, a plan came to him: Make a git repo for all of his images, and then put that into the IDE!
So, the little elf made this repo, and everything was good.
